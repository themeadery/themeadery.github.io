I've been running an [RDQ 550mAh 3S](https://www.racedayquads.com/collections/rdq-series-batteries/products/rdq-550mah-3s-fpv-battery-for-2-and-3-quads-80c-xt30) for a while now. I think it is a fantastic battery. No complaints at all, and the price is great. I've been able to get 10m30s flight times on my Tadpole 3" with it.

I recently ordered a [GNB 550mAh 3S](https://fpvcycle.com/products/gnb-500mah-90c-180c-1s-6s-lipo-battery) from [FPV Cycle](https://fpvcycle.com) and noticed it was significantly smaller. Had to throw them on the scale. 55.4 grams vs 42.1 -- WOW! Not to mention it advertises a boost in C-rating: 70C vs 90C/180C (burst).

Now to be fair, I have not tested flight times or actual mAh capacity, but if it's anywhere near the same as my old RDQ I will be impressed. Ever forward march of technology, eh?
