I finally got around to making a GitHub repo for a python script I had been working on for a while.

It started off as a way to control my saltwater reef aquarium using my computer sitting right next to it and a FT232H from Adafruit. It then morphed into a way to check the inside and outside temperature and humidity, which was very useful during a recent HVAC evaporator coil failure and replacement.
