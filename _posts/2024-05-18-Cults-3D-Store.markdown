Over the last few years I have been building a portfolio of functional 3D print designs. The idea was to eventually sell the files or the prints when I felt comfortable that the designs were good enough and I knew what I was doing.

Well, the time has come. I've chosen [Cults 3D](https://cults3d.com/en/users/The_Meadery/3d-models) as the first place to host and [sell my designs](https://cults3d.com/en/users/The_Meadery/3d-models).

I have a more designs that I will be releasing soon after I polish them up and generate all the media for sharing. Stay tuned!
