Currently I am designing functional parts for 3D printing and offering them for sale on my [Cults 3D Store](https://cults3d.com/en/users/The_Meadery/3d-models).  
If you think I can design something for you that won't make my brain explode from complexity [contact me here](mailto:matt@themeadery.buzz) or on [my socials](/about/). I design using Fusion 360 and Solidworks.

Update December 2021: I am no longer offering any NFT, WAX or KCC services. Below has been preserved for posterity.
